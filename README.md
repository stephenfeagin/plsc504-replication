Title: README: Term Paper
Authors: Stephen Feagin, Nate Grubman, Stephen Herzog
Date: December 18, 2015

This repository contains source code for a replication of Jessica Weeks (2012),
"Strongmen and Straw Men: Authoritarian Regimes and the Initiation of 
International Conflict," *American Political Science Review* 106, no. 02 (May):
326-347.

This project was conducted for PLSC 504: Advanced Quantitative Methods, at
Yale University. 

The repository contains data files, R markdown files and output for the base
replication, and the source code for the final paper.

Because I am excluding .pdf files from the repository, I include in this README
the text of the file "Coauthorship and Responsibilities for Term Paper" in order
to properly attribute the work that my coauthors and I did.

In the initial commit, I submit the code exactly as it was submitted for the
course assignment. In future commits, I may clean up formatting to make it more
readable. However, I will not substantively change any of the analysis.

## Co-authorship and Responsibilities for Term Paper

Stephen Feagin contributed to sections 1, 2, and 3 of the paper and is the primary author
of the paper’s appendix. Stephen was responsible for developing the bulk of figures used
throughout this paper. He also developed code, alongside Nate, to analyze Weeks’s models
and was responsible for the calculation of robust standard errors and the data analysis of
historical regime type counts.

Nate Grubman was the lead author on sections 1 and 2 of the paper, a contributing author
to section 3, and played a strong role in editing and making additions throughout the rest of
the paper. Additionally, Nate spearheaded much of the initial heavy-lifting and data analysis
for Weeks’s first, parsimonious model. He worked with the rest of the team to ensure that
coding for Models 1 and 2 worked and could be analyzed properly. Nate then implemented
the placebo test used in this paper.

Stephen Herzog contributed to sections 1, 2, and 3 of the paper. He is the primary author
of the textual sections 4 and 5 of the paper, which are the summary and interpretation of
data, as well as the theoretical conclusions. Further, Stephen was responsible for adapting
the team’s initial analysis coding for Weeks’s parsimonious model to her second, full model
in order to run comparative regressions.

Beyond individual responsibilities, the three authors contributed equally to the theoretical
development and research design of this project. Before they began the added-variable
analysis, the authors replicated Weeks’s original code together.
